 # Post Installation Steps

**FNV4GB Patcher:**
1. Under the `Post Installation` separator in MO2, right click on the mod `FNV 4GB Patcher` and select `Open in Explorer`

2. Copy `FNVpatch.exe` to your game's `root` folder.

3. Double click on the exe to run it.

4. A command prompt window will open and should say `FalloutNV.exe patched!`

5. Close the command prompt and a file named `FalloutNV_backup.exe` should appear in the game's `Root` folder.

**NVTF:** If you are planning on adding texture mods, please enable `Texture Modding Preset` under the `Utilities` separator.

## Optional Steps

**FPS Limiter:** Please follow the **Recommended Limiters** section of the [Performance Guide](https://performance.moddinglinked.com/falloutnv.html#RecommendedLimiters) to massively reduce your latency (this is highly recommended because the Wabbajack only comes with VSync as default, which is not meant to be used as a limiter but we cannot provide a pre-configured one).

**DXVK:** Please follow the [Performance Guide](https://performance.moddinglinked.com/falloutnv.html) for information on which DXVK version you should enable under the `Post Installation` separator. **(This is not optional for AMD users! The game will most likely crash if you don't follow this step.)** 

**BSA Decompressor:** The BSA Decompressor will give you slightly better performance and faster loading times at a small disk space cost.

1. Under the `Post Installation` separator in MO2, right click on the mod `FNV BSA Decompressor` and select `Open in Explorer`

2. Run `FNV BSA Decompressor.exe`

3. The Fallout: New Vegas and Decompressed Archives paths should be filled by default (root folder and data folder respectively). If they aren't, close the program and re-run your game launcher to generate the required registry key

4. Click Decompress, wait for the process the finish, then exit the program once finished

**NVHR:** Under the `Post Installation` separator in MO2, copy the contents of the mod `New Vegas Heap Replacer` to your game's `root` folder.
